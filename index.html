        <p style="padding-right: 30px;">
            We are students of <a href="https://www.utcreading.co.uk/" target="_blank"><b>UTC Reading</b></a>, developing a solution to Loruko Primary School in Karare, Kenya. 
            We are extremely passionate about aiding these children who are living in rural conditions, where water and basic school supplies are still a dream. 
            Partnered with the <a href="https://amuka-foundation.org" target="_blank"><b>Amuka Foundation</b></a>, we have never been presented with a more tremendous opportunity to make a real difference.
            We felt that it is our humanitarian duty to help these young souls, and <b>your donation is crucial for us.</b> 
        </p>

        <p></p>

        <h2 id="our-mission">Our Mission</h2>
        <p style="padding-right: 30px;">
            The central aim of our project is to provide students of Loruko Primary School with an adequate environment for learning,
            where the children can thrive on the success of their academic achievements. Unfortunately, many sanitary and health issues
            riddle the school, rendering children to have no choice but to suffer with diseases such as jiggers caused by parasites living
            in the concrete floors of the schools, as some students do not have suitable footwear.<br><br>

            Another problem is that African Elephants in the local area can easily detect water and destroy the existing water tanks, leaving the children 
            with little to no water. Elephants are intelligent and get used to most attempts at deterrents used by local farmers, such
            as fires, loud noises and traps that injure them. Therefore, we needed a cost-efficient and effective way of deterring elephants,
            in a manner that does not harm the elephants in the process, as many sub-species are critically endangered.<br><br>

            Finally, the school does not have any electrical power, as the solar panels it previously had were destroyed due to vandalism.
            This meant that classroom lighting is poor, reducing the effectiveness of the learning experience.
            The school kitchen is also very dangerous since they had to burn wood in an unsafe furnace, risking burns on the staff and children.
            We needed a sustainable and cheap method of producing power, so that the local people can enjoy high quality education for years to come.

        <h2 id="our-plans">Our Plans</h2>
        <h3 id="repellents">Natural Repellents Oils</h3>
        <p>
            To combat jiggers, we decided to repel the parasites with natural repellents such as rosemary and lavender oils. <br><br>
            
            This oil, diluted with ethanol, can be sprayed around the room using simple spray bottles, which can ward off the pests easily.
            We plan to educate the local people on how to make this oil and to source the raw materials from Nairobi. We will also attempt
            to grow these plants within the local area to reduce carbon emissions.
        </p>
        
        <p></p>

        <h3 id="chilli-fencing">Chilli Fencing</h3>
        <p>
            Chilli fencing is a popular technique for deterring elephants, involves sisal string, chillies and waste engine oil.
            All of these materials are very easy to obtain for repairing fences, so it is eminently practical. 
            Used by farmers from Kenya to Tanzania, it has had plenty of local success, though many do not know how it works, so we plan to educate the locals and their children on the intricacies of this technique.<br><br>

            Children can also learn to grow chillies as an extra-curricular activity. 
            Chilli-growing is a therapeutic activity which will benefit both the children's mental and physical health.​
            Locals are also able harvest the chillis and sell them, as an extra source of income, or use them to enhance their cuisine.
            Furthermore, this chilli fencing technique can be implemented in local towns or villages if the school project is successful.
        </p>
        
        <p></p>

        <h3 id="biogas">Biogas</h3>
        <p>
            Our solution to the energy problem is to construct a biogas plant with engines to produce electricity near the school.
            Biogas is chosen as it can be produced from cow manure from local farming communities, so the fuel costs are very low.
            Other methods from solar panels to connecting to the main electricity grid are examined, but they fell short due to the high cost attached to them.
        </p>

        <h2 id="fundraising">Our Fundraising Campaign</h2>
        <p>
            The distance between Nairobi, Kenya and Loruko Primary School is approximately 300 miles. We are going to cycle,
            run and travel the equivalent distance without using any electrical or powered means to raise funds for our 
            project. The distance will be split between five of us, which amounts to around 60 miles each. <b>Watch the video
            below to find out more.</b>
